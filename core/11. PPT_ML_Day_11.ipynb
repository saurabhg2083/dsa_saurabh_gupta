    "1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words in a text corpus. They are important in natural language processing because they provide a dense and continuous representation of words, enabling machines to understand the meaning and context of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word-level embeddings represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a specific feature. They capture relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns in a given corpus. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, represent words as sequences of characters and learn representations based on character-level patterns and structures. While word-level embeddings focus on word-level semantics, character-level embeddings can handle out-of-vocabulary words and capture subword-level information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, have several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Transferability: Pre-trained embeddings capture general word relationships from large-scale corpora, making them transferable to various downstream NLP tasks.\n",

    "b. Dimensionality reduction: Pre-trained embeddings reduce the dimensionality of word representations, making them more manageable and computationally efficient.\n",

These mechanisms allow RNNs to selectively retain and update information, effectively addressing the issue of long-term dependencies."
