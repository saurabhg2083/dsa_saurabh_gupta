    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective in analyzing visual data such as images. It differs from traditional neural networks by using convolutional layers, which apply filters or kernels to input data to extract features. CNNs also utilize pooling layers to downsample feature maps and reduce dimensionality. The architecture of CNNs is designed to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns in data, making them well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n",

    "Feature extraction in CNNs refers to the process of automatically learning and extracting meaningful features from input data. The convolutional layers in a CNN apply various filters to the input data, detecting different patterns and features at different spatial scales. These filters capture features such as edges, corners, and textures. By applying multiple convolutional layers, a CNN can learn hierarchical representations of the input data, with higher-level layers capturing more complex and abstract features. Feature extraction enables the CNN to learn relevant representations of the input data for the task at hand."

During training, the network's predictions are compared to the ground truth labels, and the loss is computed. The gradients of the loss with respect to the network's parameters are then propagated backward through the network, layer by layer, using the chain rule of calculus. This allows the gradients to be efficiently calculated, and the weights and biases are updated using optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss."

These transformations can include random rotations, translations, scaling, flipping, or adding noise to the images. By applying these transformations, the CNN is exposed to a wider range of variations in the data, making it more robust and less sensitive to small changes in the input. Data augmentation helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the CNN by introducing variations that are likely to occur in real-world scenarios."

    "Occlusion refers to the process of partially or completely covering a portion of an input image to observe its impact on the CNN's performance. Occlusion analysis helps understand the robustness and sensitivity of CNNs to different parts of the image. By occluding specific regions of the input image, it is possible to observe changes in the CNN's predictions. If occluding certain regions consistently leads to a drop in prediction accuracy, it suggests that those regions are crucial for the CNN's decision-making process. Occlusion analysis provides insights into the CNN's understanding of different image components and can reveal potential biases or vulnerabilities in the model. It can also be used to interpret and explain the model's behavior and identify the features or regions the model relies on for making predictions. By occluding different parts of an image and observing the resulting predictions, researchers and practitioners can gain valuable insights into the inner workings of CNNs and improve their understanding and trustworthiness.\n",

When a CNN is trained on images with a specific lighting distribution, it may learn to rely heavily on the lighting cues to make predictions. Consequently, when tested on images with different lighting conditions, the performance of the CNN can deteriorate. This is because the CNN struggles to generalize across varying illumination, leading to decreased accuracy and robustness.To address the impact of illumination changes, techniques such as data augmentation with different lighting conditions, normalizing images for illumination variations, or using illumination-invariant features can be employed. Additionally, training CNNs on a diverse dataset that includes images with varying lighting conditions can help improve their generalization and robustness to illumination changes.\n",

    "Illumination changes can significantly impact CNN performance, particularly when the model is trained on images with specific lighting conditions and then tested on images with different lighting conditions. Illumination changes refer to variations in the lighting intensity, direction, or color temperature across different images.\n",

    "When a CNN is trained on images with a specific lighting distribution, it may learn to rely heavily on the lighting cues to make predictions. Consequently, when tested on images with different lighting conditions, the performance of the CNN can deteriorate. This is because the CNN struggles to generalize across varying illumination, leading to decreased accuracy and robustness.\n",
